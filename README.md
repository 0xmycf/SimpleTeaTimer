# SimpleTeaTimer - Haskell Edition!
A simple CLI Tea Timer, so you know how long to brew those leaves!  
It does not account for non-linear brewing.

Recipes from here: [Meileaf](https://meileaf.com)  
He published a free guide once, if you can't find it and are interested feel free to msg me.

# Teas (In 功夫 Gung Fu style)

Enter anything (except the teas listed, to see an overview)

- white
- green
- yellow
- oolong_strip
- oolong_ball
- puerh_ripe
- puerh_strip

German names work too.

# Windows & Linux
I use some funny command to announce that the tea is done, but this is a mac command, so idk what happens on Windows/Linux.

Needless to say, this is one of my few projects that I did to try out another language.

# Scala
