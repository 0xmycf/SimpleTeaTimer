# Teas (In 功夫 Gung Fu style)

Run with `-teas` to get an overview.

- white
- green
- yellow
- oolong_strip
- oolong_ball
- puerh_ripe
- puerh_strip
- black

German names work too.

# Windows & Linux
I use some funny command to announce that the tea is done, but this is a mac command, so idk what happens on Windows/Linux.

Needless to say, this is one of my few projects that I did to try out another language.
